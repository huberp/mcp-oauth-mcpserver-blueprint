## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Session Storage Migration** (#3)
   - **Risk**: Data loss during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement gradual rollout, backup sessions
   
2. **Test Coverage Increase** (#1)
   - **Risk**: Tests may uncover existing bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Fix bugs as discovered, prioritize critical paths

3. **Token Expiry/Refresh** (#4)
   - **Risk**: Breaking existing authentication
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, gradual rollout

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Code Refactoring** (#16, #24)
   - **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring

2. **Structured Logging** (#6)
   - **Risk**: Performance impact
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, use async logging

### Low Risk Items
1. **Documentation** (#12, #22, #23)
   - **Risk**: Minimal - documentation only
   - **Mitigation**: None needed
