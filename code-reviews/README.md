## How to Use This Directory

### For New Reviews

1. Create a new dated subdirectory: `YYYY-MM-DD-review-name/`
2. Follow the structure outlined above
3. Use `code-review-instructions.md` as a guide
4. Update this README with a summary of the new review

### For Existing Reviews

1. Navigate to the review directory
2. Start with the `README.md` in that directory
3. Review findings in `CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`
4. Create GitHub issues using the guide

### Using Helper Scripts

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (Recommended)

The easiest way to create issues is using the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Go to **Actions** → **Create Code Review Issues**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Configure options:
   - **dry_run**: `true` to preview, `false` to create issues
   - **start_issue**: First issue number to create (1-24)
   - **end_issue**: Last issue number to create (1-24)
4. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow will parse the CODE_REVIEW_ISSUES.md file and create GitHub issues automatically with proper labels and formatting.

#### Manual Script

Alternatively, the `create-review-issues.sh` script template is available for manual use:

```bash
cd code-reviews
./create-review-issues.sh
```

## Review Methodology

All reviews follow a consistent methodology:

1. **Scope Analysis**: Analyze all source files, tests, documentation, and configurations
2. **Category Assessment**: Evaluate across multiple categories:
   - Architecture & Code Organization
   - Security & Authentication
   - Testing & Coverage
   - Error Handling & Logging
   - API Design (MCP Protocol Compliance)
   - Configuration Management
   - Observability & Monitoring
   - CI/CD & DevOps
   - Documentation
   - Code Quality & Maintainability
   - Performance

3. **Issue Identification**: Create focused, actionable issues
4. **Prioritization**: Classify by priority (High/Medium/Low) and effort
5. **Roadmap Creation**: Provide phased implementation plan

## Issue Guidelines

Each issue should:
- Be scoped for completion by a single coding agent
- Focus on a particular task
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Specify files to modify
- Have appropriate labels and priority
- Estimate effort (Small/Medium/Large)

---

## Maintenance

- Reviews should be conducted periodically (quarterly recommended)
- After major features or refactors
- Before production deployments
- When team requests assessment
