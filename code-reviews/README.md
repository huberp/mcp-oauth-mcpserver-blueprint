## Review Methodology

All reviews follow a consistent methodology:

1. **Scope Analysis**: Analyze all source files, tests, documentation, and configurations
2. **Category Assessment**: Evaluate across multiple categories:
   - Architecture & Code Organization
   - Security & Authentication
   - Testing & Coverage
   - Error Handling & Logging
   - API Design (MCP Protocol Compliance)
   - Configuration Management
   - Observability & Monitoring
   - CI/CD & DevOps
   - Documentation
   - Code Quality & Maintainability
   - Performance

3. **Issue Identification**: Create focused, actionable issues
4. **Prioritization**: Classify by priority (High/Medium/Low) and effort
5. **Roadmap Creation**: Provide phased implementation plan

---

## Issue Guidelines

Each issue should:
- Be scoped for completion by a single coding agent
- Focus on a particular task
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Specify files to modify
- Have appropriate labels and priority
- Estimate effort (Small/Medium/Large)

---

## Maintenance

- Reviews should be conducted periodically (quarterly recommended)
- After major features or refactors
- Before production deployments
- When team requests assessment
